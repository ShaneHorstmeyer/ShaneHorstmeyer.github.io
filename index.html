        <p>My name is Shane Horstmeyer and I have been learning a lot about about
        coding, but first let me tell you about myself first. For Starters, people 
        that know know me would first bring up my kindness. Probably because I put 
        others above myself so much so that I need to make sure I do things for 
        meself sometimes. Additionally, I can learn things fast and can also work 
        hard as well. Most things I can pick up fast some things take a little longer 
        and after I learn it then all thats left is to do the work at one hundred 
        percent. Finally, creativity is one of my strong suits so much so sometimes 
        it's hard to turn off. Just so you now I do know how to turn it off but 
        get me on a topic and the ideas will flow like water. In conclusion, theres 
        more things about who I am but that would be a life story, so this is the 
        run down of who I am.</p>

        <p>I am willing to do more then just coding for video games. For example, 
        working in other coding languages would also work just as good. I am also 
        willing to learn and work on new things that I don't know because any expirience 
        is good to me. So if you think I would right for the job just send me a 
        message and find out.</p>
