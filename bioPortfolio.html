        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>Allow me to tell you about the schooling I have went though. First is 
        I went to Lodi High School and learned a wide variety of things. Next came 
        Madison College which is where I learned HTML, CSS and Java. That would of 
        been it but Madison College was missing a big thing I wanted to know how 
        to do. Which leads me to University of Advancing Technology(UAT) where I 
        learn C++ and some other useful information. That is the extent of my schooling 
        but I'm always willing to learn more.</p>

        <h2>Work Ethic</h2>
        <p>Now a bit of extra info about who I am and how I work. Let me start with 
        how I think and my view on things. In a short way, very logically but also 
        can be persuaded with some good proof. When it comes to how I work I tend 
        to work in more bursts. Because at the moment it is a little hard to focus 
        so when I do I do a lot. Lastly, when it comes to disagreements I try not 
        to put feelings into it and more facts. Am I the best at it, no but this 
        way it's actually productive in a way and not just diffent views. Hopfully 
        that gave you a look at how I think and work with most things.</p>
        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>This is about some of the great skills I have and slowly getting better 
        with and more of. I will have to start with creativity for it is very useful 
        in many situations. More so when it comes to presentation but still can 
        give flare in many other areas. Similarly, a skill the happens to work well 
        with creativity is experimentative. Granted you could say it's a bad thing 
        because it takes more time but it can result into something spectacular. 
        Last but not least my good in a time crunch and/or restraint. So if you 
        were worried about my speed in projects I can always "turn on the gas" as 
        they say. The thing you may have noticed is all this skills alone are good 
        but together there amazing.</p>
