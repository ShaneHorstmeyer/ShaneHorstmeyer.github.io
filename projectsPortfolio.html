        <p>When it comes do to the experiences and training I have received, right 
        now theres not a lot but there will be more in the future. At the moment 
        all the training was though the schooling and a few things that I learn 
        myself. Right now I'm under experienced but I will learn more though any 
        means as well as the opportunities to come.</p>
