        <p>When it comes do to the experiences and training I have received, right 
        now theres not a lot but there will be more in the future. At the moment 
        all the training was though the schooling and a few things that I learn 
        myself. Right now I'm under experienced but I will learn more though any 
        means as well as the opportunities to come.</p>

        <p>I helped on a board game project call "Ravenous Sharks". I didn't do much of coding in this project but 
            I did learn to work with a team and to be flexable to help peoples work. I mainly did artwork for the 
            project and this is one example of my works.</p>
